Simple playbooks to make XCBC easier

Ansible handles post-Rocks installation configuration.

Currently working:

 -- install the XSEDE yum repo for future updates (maybe a bad idea!)

 -- install and config a basic globus endpoint server, along with
    all client software

 -- update the current rocks install with packages brought in
    from Yum

 -- install and config a basic torque queue
